<h2>Coding Excerise </h2>

There are three source files. **CityListA.json**, **CityListB.avro**, and **CityListC.csv**.
They each contain data in three columns:

  * name:string
  * code:string
  * Population:long

The goal is to combine the files, eliminating any duplicates and write to a single .CSV file sorted alphabetically by the city name. You can use any technology that you prefer.  The desired solution should be as generic, repeatable, and as automated as possible.  Once the dataset is completed, answer the following questions (and provide an explanation of how you determined your answer with any applicable code):
  1) What is the count of all rows?
  2) What is the city with the largest population?
  3) What is the total population of all cities in Brazil (CountryCode == BRA)?
  4) What changes could be made to improve your program's performance.
  5) How would you scale your solution to a much larger dataset (too large for a single machine to store)?

Your deliverable should be the following:

  * Your code to generate the dataset
  * A runbook with a guide on using your program
  * The dataset generated
  * Answers to the previous questions
